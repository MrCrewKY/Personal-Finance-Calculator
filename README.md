# Personal-Finance-Calculator
Previously was my final project for my Basic Programming subject. Turned it into my hobby to make some tweaks here and there to improve my code for fun. 
The basic function is : Enter your income > Enter your expenses > press 0 to calculate or continue to enter expenses.
I added extra functions to it by allowing to store the output into a automatically created .txt file.
Additional functions added are viewing your financial record and deleting your financial records.
