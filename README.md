# Personal-Finance-Calculator
This was my final project for my Basic Programming subject. 
Now that I'm not taking programming subjects, I turned it into my hobby to make some tweaks here and there to improve my code for fun. 

The basic function is : Enter your income > Enter your expenses > press 0 to calculate or continue to enter expenses. I added extra functions to it by allowing to store the output into a automatically created .txt file. Additional functions added are viewing your financial record and deleting your financial records.
